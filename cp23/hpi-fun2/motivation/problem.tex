One day, Christian, the CEO of \textit{Super Arrangement Productions}, entered one of their offices
to talk to an employee who complained about the lack of motivation in their company. 
Christian was quite surprised, that not only the department, but the whole company was not motivated
at all.

That is why Christian made the decision to hire a motivation agency to send the best of their coaches
to help motivate the people again.

In a brief knowledge exchange with the head of the coaches, Christian learned the following things:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each employee has a demotivational level, which tells how much effort it needs for a coach to motivate the employee again.
    \item The agency sends their best coaches with each having a specific motivational level.
    \item Motivating employees is exhausting, which means that coaches and employees motivating other employees will be less motivated, equally to the level of demotivation.
    \item Employees are motivated by at least one person, but an employee will not be willing to get motivated by a person that higher hierarchy layers did not get motivated by.
    \item After being motivated again, employees are willing to motivate other employees, but only if those employees are directly or indirectly under their current position.
\end{itemize}

Since Christian enforced saving measures, he wants to spend as little as possible. Therefore, as few coaches
as possible should be sent. They will start working with Christian himself.

Even though the whole company should become motivated again, some people simply might not be motivatable.
Christian wants to know who these people are.

\paragraph*{Input}

The input consists of three lines, describing a single test case.
The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^4$), the number of employees and the motivational level $l$ of the coaches ($1 \leq l \leq 10**5$).
The second line contains $n$ integers. The $i$th integer is $m_i$ ($-10**6 \leq m_i \leq 10**6$), the motivational level of employee $i$.
The third line contains $n - 1$ integers. The $i$th integer is $bi+1$ ($1 \leq b_{i+1} < i + 1$), the direct boss of colleague $i + 1$.

\paragraph*{Output}

Firstly, output the minimal number of coaches required to motivate the company.
Secondly, output the number of unmotivatable employees, followed by the numbers of those employees.
