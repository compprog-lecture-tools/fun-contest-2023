Motivation Coaches need to motivate company of unmotivated people

Target: Motivate all people to work better

Motivation Coaches have a level of motivation and each time, they motivate a person,
they get less motivated.

Coaches get hyped by each other, which means they accumulate their motivational level.

A motivated employee will be as motivated, as the least motivated coach, after they got coached.
(Employees MV = minimal Coach MV level)

Motivated Employees can motivate other employees too, but also get less motivated each time.

Departments, that are not (in)directly under other departments are not capable
of sending their employees to motivate employees of those deparments.

How many motivational coaches does the company need?

In rare cases, employees in the company are unmotivatable, which means that even the coaches get
demotivated, before the employees are motivated. That is why the coaching agency wants to know 
how many of the employees are actually motivated. (Print the number)
