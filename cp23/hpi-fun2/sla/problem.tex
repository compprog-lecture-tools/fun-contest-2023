Platypus Web Services (PWS) is the largest cloud-provider around and you have the honor to work as their lead network engineer.
Although PWS has many, many data centers, two of them are very important to your customers.
The data centers may have multiple uplinks to increase the maximum data rate and to ensure redundancy.
Moreover, they may be connected via multiple \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point}{internet exchange points}.
As usual, the links operate at different data rates.

It just so happens, that some links fail or are affected by maintenance, but PWS wants to provide a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to their customers.
Therefore, you are tasked to determine the maximum data rate that you can achieve between the two datacenters, if any single link in the network fails.

\paragraph*{Input}

The first line contains $n, m ~ (2 \leq n \leq 50; 0 \leq m \leq 1000)$. The next $m$ lines
contain integers $a, b, r$ denoting a bidirectional link between $a$ and $b$ with data rate $r ~ (1 \leq a, b \leq n;
1 \leq r \leq 10^6)$ in MiB / s.

\paragraph*{Output}

Output a single line containing the maximum data rate at which you can send traffic between the nodes $1$ and $n$
if any link in the network may fail.
