One fateful night, the scientist Mabel McFly woke up from the most beautiful dream: Not only did she fly among the stars in a blue box, she also enjoyed an exotic alien dish named “fruit lasagna” that doesn’t exist in real life. Back in harsh reality, she refused to say goodbye to that godlike treat and decided to take matters into her own hands: She would use the time machine she designed to nudge the past in such a way that back in the present, fruit lasagnas will have been a traditional dish deeply intertwined with the foundations of culinary history.

As everyone knows, time travel is a delicate thing. In order to precisely alter history for her dream dish, Mabel now wants to analyze the closest thing there is to the fruit lasagna in this world, the vegetable lasagna.
As a thorough researcher, she consults many vegetable lasagna historians and notes all important events in a timeline. The historians also inform her about causal dependencies between those events, meaning some event A caused another event B.

When Mabel evaluates all her notes, she realizes: She’s so close! She has uncovered almost the entire history of the vegetable lasagna’s origin. Only a single causal connection is missing and thereby prevents her from understanding the concept of vegetable lasagna on a more fundamental, holistic level.

To estimate how much research still needs to be done, she wants to find the number of possibilities for the last connection so that it still conforms to the timeline given by the historians as well as the other known connections. She knows all the events that she noted directly or indirectly caused vegetable lasagna to emerge.

Can you help Mabel understand the history of the vegetable lasagna so she can synthesize which events she needs to influence favor of the fruit lasagne?

\paragraph*{Input}

The first line contains $n$, the number of events.
Because Mabel's time-traveller’s notebook is bigger on the inside, she can note $2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$ events.

The second line is the timeline and contains events in the order they occurred in.
Events are given by their ID $e_i \in {0,...,n-1}$.
The last event in the timeline is the invention of the vegetable lasagna.

Next, there are $n-2$ connections as cause-effect-pairs \texttt{a b} with $a,b \in {0, \ldots ,n-1}$.

\paragraph*{Output}

If the given connections already contradict the given timeline, print \texttt{ask historians again}.

Otherwise, print two lines: \\
On the first line print $p$, the number of possibilities for the last connection. \\
On the second line print \texttt{a b} an arbitrary possible connection.
