\epigraph{``Setz dich nicht so nah vor den Fernseher - du bekommst noch
  viereckige Augen!\\ \textit{Don't sit so close to the TV - you'll get square
    eyes!}''}{Your parents}

You were told often enough by your parents, but of course you didn't believe them.

Now, staring on computer screens all day to solve competitive programming tasks, the threat has turned into bitter reality.

You only see the world as 1cm x 1cm x 1cm large aligned blocks, even after switching profession to be a meteorologist, your sight hasn't cleared.

One day, your new boss asks you to calculate the surface area of a large cloud in the sky, so the National Weather Modification Service can shoot the right amount of silver iodide into the sky to let the cloud rain down.

There might be no cloud at all if the weather is good, but if there is a cloud, it can also be disconnected.

Can you calculate the surface area of the water drops in the cloud, which you only see as little cubes?

\paragraph*{Input}

In the first line, you get $0 \leq n \leq 10^5$ - number of water drop blocks.
Each of the next $n$ lines contains 3 integer coordinates $0 \leq x, y, z \leq 10^{12}$ of a water block. It is not guaranteed that the blocks are connected, but they are pairwise distinct.

\paragraph*{Output}

The surface area of the cloud.
